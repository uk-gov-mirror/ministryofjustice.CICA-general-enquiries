This includes the victim's name, date of birth and address. You also have to include an application reference number in any contact you have with us about an existing application.\r\n\r\nYou need to contact us immediately to let us know if:\r\n\r\n* your contact or personal details change\r\n* you stop using or change representative\r\n* you get compensation or money from any other sources after you apply in relation to the incident\r\n* you have new information to add to your application\r\n* information you provided previously has changed\r\n\r\nWe do not routinely acknowledge the correspondence we receive and will only contact you if we need to obtain medical or other information and when we make a decision on your application. If you have recently applied for compensation, we will be carrying out the necessary initial enquiries and ask that you await contact from us. \r\n\r\nWe aim to assess claims as quickly as possible and most are assessed within 12 months. However, the compensation we pay is not intended to meet immediate need. Complex cases will take longer to finalise to ensure that we can make a payment which reflects the severity of the injuries sustained and their long-term impact. \r\n\r\nRead more about how we protect your information in our [privacy notice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cica-privacy-notice). \r\n\r\n## Other ways of contacting CICA\r\n\r\n* Telephone: 0300 003 3601\r\n* From outside the UK: +44 20 3684 2517\r\n* [Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com/) (if you cannot hear or speak on the phone): 18001 0300 003 3601\r\n* [Find out about call charges](https://www.gov.uk/call-charges)\r\n\r\nOur phone lines are open: \r\n\r\n* Monday, 8:30am to 5pm\r\n* Tuesday, 8:30am to 5pm\r\n* Wednesday, 8:30am to 3pm\r\n* Thursday, 8:30am to 5pm\r\n* Friday, 8:30am to 5pm\r\n ",
